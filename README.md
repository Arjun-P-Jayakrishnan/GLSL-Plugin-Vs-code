# GLSL Plugin For VS Code

Vs-code extension for GL Shader Language (.glsl) syntax highlighting.

## Features

Extension is designed to provide syntax highlights to your glsl code with the extensions ".glsl" ,".vert", and ".frag".

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.

## Requirements

GLSL syntax highlights are meant for .glsl or .vert or .frag files and hence advised to name them as such.

## Extension Settings

For example:

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `myExtension.enable`: Enable/disable this extension.
* `myExtension.thing`: Set to `blah` to do something.
